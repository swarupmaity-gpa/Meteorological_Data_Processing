# Meteorological Data Processing with R

This project involves processing meteorological data stored in netCDF format using R programming language.

## Overview

The provided R script (`meteorological_data_processing.R`) demonstrates a workflow for processing and analyzing meteorological data stored in netCDF files. The script utilizes various R packages to handle netCDF files, manipulate data, and visualize results.

## Features

- Extracts metadata and data from netCDF files.
- Reshapes and processes data, including converting time information and replacing fill values.
- Calculates annual means and prepares data for export.
- Exports processed data to CSV and raster formats.

## Usage

To use this project:
1. Ensure you have R installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Install required R packages listed in the script (`ncdf4`, `chron`, `lattice`, `RColorBrewer`, `raster`, `sp`).
4. Run the provided R script (`meteorological_data_processing.R`) in your R environment.

## Data Source

The meteorological data used in this project is sourced from the MERRA-2 dataset (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2).
